This repository showcases how adaptive finite element solvers using equilibration based a posteriori error estimates can be build. Thefore, FEniCSx alongside with dolfinx_eqlb, an extension for efficient flux equilibration are used. Classical benchmarks for Poisson problem (L-shaped domain [1] and variants of the Kelloggs problem [2] [3]) and linear elasticity (manufactured solution and Cooks membrane [4]) are shown. The here presented code can be used to repoduce the results presented in [4].
